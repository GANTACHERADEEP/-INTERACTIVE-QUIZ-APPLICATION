## Project Description: Interactive Quiz Application
The Interactive Quiz Application is a lightweight, user-friendly web-based project designed to engage users with instant feedback as they answer a series of questions. Built using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application offers a smooth and responsive interface suitable for educational or entertainment purposes.The motivation behind developing this quiz app was to create a dynamic platform that enhances learning and memory retention through interactive questioning. this is a  static quiz format so after the user has answered all the 10 questions then the user can see the result and one can retry as many times he like 
The development environment for this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code) — a popular, powerful code editor favored for its lightweight performance, vast extension support, and intelligent code completion features. VS Code made it easier to organize files, test the app in real-time using Live Server, and debug efficiently using its built-in console and browser integration.

The entire app was structured around three core files:

index.html: Handles the layout and structure of the quiz interface, including buttons, questions, options, and score display.

styles.css: Provides styling to ensure a visually appealing and mobile-responsive design. Flexbox and basic media queries were used for layout adjustments.

source.js: Contains the core functionality — loading questions, validating answers, displaying feedback, updating scores, and navigating between questions.

During the development phase, I frequently used quickref.me as a valuable resource for syntax referencing and quick lookups. It served as a handy guide for reviewing JavaScript methods, CSS properties, and DOM manipulation techniques. For example, I referenced event handling in JavaScript (addEventListener, setTimeout, etc.) and many ppther syntaxes through quickref.me while writing interactive functions.

so i conclude by saying that this task has given me the oppertunity to understand the basics of the front end web dovelopment
